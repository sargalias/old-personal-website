This premise reminds us that complexity increases exponentially with scale. See [Programming complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_complexity).

As the number of entities in our code increases, the possible number of interactions between them increases exponentially.

In other words, **any insufficient or imperfect processes during development will have an exponentially negative effect later**.

Our solution to that must be that we always keep complexity as low as possible, to minimize the effects of its exponential increase as the system scales.
