Now that we have our requirements, we examine our premises / postulates / assumptions.

The first premise is that we can only hold limited information.

This is a consequence of us being human and how the brain works.

Maybe you've heard that we can only remember 7 plus or minus 2 bits of information at any time. ([The magical number seven, plus or minus two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two))

Regardless of the exact truthfulness of that statement, the point remains.

**We can only remember / be aware of limited information at any one time.**
